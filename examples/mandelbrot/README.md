# Mandelbrot Example

Compute the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
in streaming fashion while simultaneously updating the image in a UI-based
application.

An excellent example that has been used to independently demonstrate features
of the scientific python ecosystem, as well as the utility of distributed 
computing for scientific applications requiring streaming feedback as well as
having computationally-intensive components.

## Matplotlib Mandelbrot Example

For computing the Mandelbrot set, we will use the 
[Mandelbrot example from the Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/examples/showcase/mandelbrot.html)
as our starting point.
