# Examples

This directory contains examples of building applications with
`sciapp_toolkit`.
All examples are currently based on Qt, though they can be expanded to include
other UI toolkits like Tk or Wx.

## Example 1: Mandelbrot Set

An example of a streaming-update UI that allows the user to interactively
"dive" down into the Mandelbrot set.
The Mandelbrot computation is based on the showcase example in the
[matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/examples/showcase/mandelbrot.html).
